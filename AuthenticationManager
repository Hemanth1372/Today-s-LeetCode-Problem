// Given an array prices[] of non-negative integers,
// representing the prices of the stocks on different days.
// The task is to find the maximum profit possible by buying and
// selling the stocks on different days when at most one transaction
// is allowed. Here one transaction means 1 buy + 1 Sell. If it is not
// possible to make a profit then return 0.

// Note: Stock must be bought before being sold.
